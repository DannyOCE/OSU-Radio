# OSU-Radio

A simple little program which allows you to listen to your OSU! songs, Just set your directory click save and hit shuffle.

It's got a search bar I added which lets you type in a specific song you might want to listen to. (Case Sensitive)

As for the code part its pretty messy, it was only meant to just be something I wrote for a friend but I decided to release on here. If I get time I may clean it up.
